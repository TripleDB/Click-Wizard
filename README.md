# Click Wizard

Click Wizard is a Python-based automation tool that allows users to automate mouse clicks on their computer screen. With a simple and intuitive graphical user interface, 
users can specify the X and Y coordinates of where they want the click to occur, as well as the number of clicks to be executed and the duration of time between each 
click. Additionally, users can choose to have the duration randomized to simulate a more natural and human-like clicking pattern.

Click Wizard is ideal for automating repetitive tasks such as filling out forms, navigating websites, or playing games. The user-friendly interface and 
customizable options make it accessible to users of all levels of technical proficiency. Click Wizard is built using the PyAutoGUI library, which ensures that the 
tool is both reliable and robust. 

To get started, simply download Click Wizard and run the program on your local machine. The graphical user interface will guide you through the process of specifying 
the coordinates, clicks, and duration of the automation task. Once you are satisfied with your settings, click the "Run" button to start the automation process. 

We hope you find Click Wizard useful for your automation needs. If you encounter any issues or have any feedback, please feel free to reach out to me.
